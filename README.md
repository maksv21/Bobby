Chrome extensions based fonts viewer

Demo: https://maksv21.github.io/Bobby/

<p>This application was created a short time after starting to learn JS, the code is complex, the architecture is poor, but it works, it starts in a second and the customer liked
   
   All the code is written in one file, at that time I could figure out a huge file, now there is no such skill and I have to make modules :(</p>

<h4>Installing</h4>
<p>Chrome -> three dots on the right -> More tools -> Extensions -> On Developer mode -> Load unpacked</p>

<h4>Other</h4>
<p>Icons taken from https://material.io/resources/icons/</p>
